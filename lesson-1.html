        <p>Welcome to the GWC App Project. This is lesson one. These lessons are designed to be a structure in which you create.  You will get out of these lessons what you put in. Thus ask questions, try hard, and use this as a spring-board to better things.</p>
        <h2>Creating a Basic App</h2>
        <p>We are using a technology called "Apache Cordova". This technology allows us to create one software project that runs on your phone, my phone, a web browser, and many different devices. In addition, the code is all done with standard web technologies which run the internet and much more. Thus is is well worth-while to learn</p>
        <p>We will find that the technology is pretty non-intrusive but it does take a spot of setup. That is what we are doing here<p>
        <h3>Create a Blank Cordova Project</h3>
        <code>
        cordova create gwc_app_project org.sanmarinohs.gwc.app "GWC App Project" 
        </code>
        <p>Here we create a new app with the following properties.
        <ul>
            <li>gwc_app_project: the folder that stores our project code</li>
            <li>org.sanmarinohs.gwc.app: the code-name for this project, in reverse domain format</li>
            <li>"GWC App Project": the human-readible name for our project</li> 
        </ul>
        <em>Note:</em>Feel free to personalize these items.
